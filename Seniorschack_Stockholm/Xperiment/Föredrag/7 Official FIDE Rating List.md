1. On the first day of each month, FIDE shall prepare a list which incorporates all rated play during the rating period into the previous list. This shall be done using the rating system formula.

	1. The rating period (for new players, see 7.1.4) is the period where a certain rating list is valid.

	2. The following data will be published concerning each player whose rating is at least 1400 as of the current list: FIDE title, Federation, Current Rating, ID Number, Number of games rated in the rating period, Year of Birth, Gender and the current value of K for the player.

	3. The closing date for tournaments for a list is 3 days before the date of the list; tournaments ending before or on that day may be rated on the list. Official FIDE events may be rated on the list even if they end on the last day before the list date.

	4. **A rating for a player new to the list** shall be published when it is based on at least 5 games against rated opponents. This need not be met in one tournament. Results from other tournaments played within consecutive rating periods of not more than 26 months are pooled to obtain the initial rating. The rating must be at least 1400.

2. Players who are not to be included on the list or to be shown as inactive:

	1. **Players whose ratings drop below 1400 are shown as unrated on the next list**. Thereafter they are treated in the same manner as any other unrated player.

	2. Players listed as active:
		1. A player is considered to commence inactivity if they play no rated games in a one-year period.  
		2. A player regains their activity if they play at least one rated game in a period.  They are then listed as active on the next list.
